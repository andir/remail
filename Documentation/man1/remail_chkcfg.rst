Invocation
----------

The program expects a properly populated configuration directory at the
place where the config_file is. If the program is invoked from outside the
configuration directory the program changes into the configuration
directory according to the directory part of the config_file argument.

If the configuration file is the base configuration file the program
expects the list configuration files of the enabled lists to be available
in the lists subdirectory.

If it is invoked with a list specific configuration file it only checks and
shows this part. If not disabled it checks for the availability and validity
of the keys for each subscriber.
