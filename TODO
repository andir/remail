Non-comprehensive todo list:

- Add Python setup.py

- Add Debian/RPM packaging

- Write a proper service file

- Mail command processing (FREEZE/UNFREEZE of subscribers, UNFREEZE of
  frozen messages). Most of the code is already available, I just need
  to find the time to clean it up and move it over from the old python2
  based version which served us well for more than a year.
